  \tableofcontents

  \section Introduction

  REMORA is currently under development as a next-generation version of
  the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). It is designed to run on a wide range
  of machines, from laptops to multicore CPU and hybrid CPU-GPU systems.

  \section amr Adaptive Mesh Refinement

  REMORA is built on
  <a href="https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex">AMReX</a> an adaptive
  mesh refinement software framework, which provides the underlying
  software infrastructure for block structured adaptive mesh refinement
  operations. Full AMReX documentation can be found in the
  <a href="https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/">user guide</a>
  and in the
  <a href="https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorials_html/">
