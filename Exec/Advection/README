The Advection problem tests scalar advection of a gaussian concentration
distribution on a doubly-periodic domain with flat bathymetry.

The file called inputs contains the single-level version of this test. The
file called inputs_ml runs the problem with adaptive mesh refinement, refining
where the scalar has a value greater than 0.5.
